  - Another year, another letter! So many great things have happened this year I'm sure I won't be able to get to them all. But here are some highlights!
  - Yes, it's us again. You thought turning out the lights and keeping quiet would keep us away? Ha! We're like political candidates in a local election! We'll always find you. </p><p> We've done so much this year, it's hard to know where to start. Here are some highlights.
  - Welcome to the Williams' annual letter. I'm sure there were amazing things that were accomplished this year, but for the life of me I can't remember them. Anyway, without further ado, here are some things that may or may not have happened.

:closing:
  - We hope you had as great a year as we did and an even better next year!
  - Well, we've run out of bits, so we'll have to close this letter. Hope you have a great new year!
  - And, we're done.
  - So long. Thanks for all the fish.
